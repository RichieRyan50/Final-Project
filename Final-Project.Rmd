#Precis: The "fandango_score_comparison.csv" dataset contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a RT User rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. 24, 2015. The "fandango_scrape.csv" dataset contains every film that was pulled from Fandango. I will use this data to perform analyses on movie ratings from various sources. I may possibly do analyses that compare user and critic ratings among various ratings sources.
